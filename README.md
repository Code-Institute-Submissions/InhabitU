## InhabitU is a tool, to help users to keep thier good habits up and reduce the bad one.

InhabitU
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
InhabitU is an application to facilitate and keep track on a balanced lifestyle. Options to create, edit and keep track on frequent habits in the three categories “Heart”, “Body” and “Brain” make it easy to stay motivated and keep an overview over how well we balance and spend time in the three categories.
UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
The application is made for everyone that feels it hard sometimes to bring the three main categories that define our physical and mental well-being in balance. In a rushed everyday life, it can be hard to equally set out time on staying fit and healthy (“Body”), spending time with friends and family and (“Heart”) as well as being focused and centered in our mind (“Brain”). Defining and following habits can help to achieve a balance, stay motivated and not forget of one of the categories. InhabitU enables the user to achieve this balance through a habit-based approach. It provides options to create habits for each three categories, edit them according to changing circumstances and keep track in a personal profile and overview. Pre-defined habits help to be inspired and get going. 

User stories
As a user I want to create and edit a personal profile, so that I can store and return to my created habit-lists and overviews

InhabitU enables the user by providing an option to register in the page and create a personal profile

As a user I want to create new habits, so that I can be more active in a certain category of my life-balance

InhabitU enables the user in his/her profile with an option to create new habits, linked to the three categories “heart, brain and body” and add them to a personal list of active habits

As a user I want to define new habits by name and description, so that I can easily remember and return to their purpose

In the “create a new habit” dialogue the user can give it a name and longer description

As a user I want to define a frequency for each habit, so that I can stay motivated and get a regularity in my daily life 

In the “create a new habit” dialogue the user can define a frequency for the habit

As a user I want to mark certain habits as prioritised, so that I can be remembered on what is important just now 

In the “create a new habit” dialogue the user can set “prioritize” to the habit he or she creates

As a user I want to edit a habit, so I can adapt it to new circumstances in my life

InhabitU enables the user in the “my habits” overview with an option to edit existing habits

As a user I want to delete a habit, so I can get more time to spend on another habit or category

InhabitU enables the user in the “my habits” overview with an option to delete existing habits

As a user I want to chose from pre-defined habits, so I can be inspired to focus equally on heart, body and brain

InhabitU provides the user with predefined habits to choose from and add to “my habits”

As a user I want to edit pre-defined habits, so I can perfectly match them to my personal circumstances

InhabitU has an option to edit predefined habits before adding them to “my habits”

As a user I want to easily see which category my habits belong to, so that I can understand their purpose and focus-point

Habits in the users overview “my habits” appear in different colors and show an icon, according to their category

As a user I want to see in a simple diagram how many habits I actively follow in each category, so that I can keep track if I have a balance in my lifestyle

Under “my profile” inhabitU provides the user with a diagram that visualizes how many singular habits he or she actively has in his or her list 

Color theme
In order to make it easy for users to keep track on the three categories and linked habits the application design is based on a color-coding system, supported by icons that visualize each category. 
The overall color theme of the menu is kept in a simple and calm background color, giving space to the three categories, which are the main content and focus point for the user:
The heart category and all linked habits are designed in red, a warm color, which is commonly referred to love, and relationship related topics
The body category and all linked habits are designed in blue, a colder and dynamic color, which inspires the user to physical activities and more movement
The brain category and all linked habits are designed in green, a color that stays for growth and positivity. It inspires the user to stay focused, grow new lifestyles and be motiviated

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
